# AutoWP

This python script was designed to automate scanning WordPress sites with two different tools: CMSmap & wpscan.

The general flow is:
	1. Scan website
	2. Write report
	3. Perform diff on current file and previous file
	4. Send email if new vulnerabilities are found.


Currently only the scanning and writing a report is finished. I have no plans to continue this project as it was a side project for a job I was working at the time.
